# Minesweeper game

A short description taken from the minesweeper site:

“Minesweeper rules are very simple. The board is divided into cells, with mines randomly
distributed. To win, you need to open all the cells. The number on a cell shows the number of mines
adjacent to it. Using this information, you can determine cells that are safe, and cells that
contain mines. Cells suspected of being mines can be marked with a flag using the right mouse
button.”

## Quick requirement notes

- A board with cells
- Random distributed mines
- Number in cell displaying adjacent mines
- Cells can be flagged as bomb
- The game is "won" when all the cells are opened or flagged correctly
